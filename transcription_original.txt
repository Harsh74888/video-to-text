 Empowerment is authority. It is a sign permission slip to actually seize the day. It's the process of getting stronger and more confident and more engaged and to be empowered is to move through the world without any kind of fear or any kind of apology. And with these gifts comes an even deeper privilege, I believe. And that is the ability to take charge of your own life, to own yourself and claim your right. And here's what I know for sure, that to whom much is given, much is expected. And I have been given so much. I've earned it. I've been blessed with it. But I've been given a lot. And that's why I've chosen to use my life to lift other people up. Nobody's journey is seamless or smooth. We all stumble. We all have setbacks. If things go wrong, you hit a dead end as you will. It's just life's way of saying time to change course. So ask every failure. This is what I do. Every failure, every crisis, every difficult time. I say, what is this here to teach me? And as soon as you get the lesson, you get to move on. If you really get the lesson, you pass and you don't have to repeat the class. If you don't get the lesson, it shows up wearing another pair of pants to give you some remedial work.
